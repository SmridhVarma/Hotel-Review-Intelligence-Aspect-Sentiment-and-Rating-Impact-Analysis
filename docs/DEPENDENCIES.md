## Critical path to a running agent

```
data.xlsx
  └─ Stage 1 ──► sentences.csv
                   └─ Stage 2 ──► aspect_dictionary.json
                   └─ Stage 3 ──► aspect_sentences.csv ──► Stage 5 ──► chromadb/ ──► Stage 6
                                  review_features.csv
                                    └─ Stage 4 ──► shap_summary.json ──► Stage 5
```

Stage 5 (ingest) is the last blocking dependency before the agent runs. It needs both `aspect_sentences.csv` (Module A) and `shap_summary.json` (Module B).
